# Exercise 4


>Calculator methods:

### 1. Add:
Adds two input numbers and return the result
### 2. Minus:
Two input numbers are counted minus and return the result
### 3. Divide:
Divide two numbers and return the result
### 4. Multiply:
Multiply two numbers and return the result

In my calculator test class I added eight testcases. Two for each method and
therefore I got 100 % test coverage.

> Test methods for each calculation method

### 1. Expected
- calculated the output by myself
### 2. Actual 
- checked if the calculation of the method is true by
calculating the input
